###### SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE
# SSCC Spec.

**Version** : 0.1.0-draft

<br>

## Abstract

This document present a diagram model are created to help achitects decribe easily and in more concise manner their architecture. This new model introduce few simple drawings expressing how a global system is architectured.
You will be able to described all things that your architecture is compose of; going from the global overview to a more detail view.

## Background

This architecture model is inspired by the well known [C4-model](http://c4model.com/). As this model, the SSCC model is simple and clear. It focuses on a small problem/scope to address : use simple drwaing to describe small and even complex systems.

UML diagrams are great and it can be used to express almost any software architecture. But it comes with some bottlenecks : 
  - Diagrams could be hard to remember and complex to use
  - Diagrams are often too expressive than they need to be
  - The same UML Drawings means different things regarding the type of Diagrams you are using

Quite often, architecture diagrams start with some annotated simple drawings as polygones and lines.
When this is already clear for everyone, we add some complexity by transforming our drawings to UML Diagrams.
Therefore, we tend to loose visibily and clarity.

I'm nothing saying that UML is useless; I think UML specifications are well suited for purposes such as:
  - Code generation based on UML Diagrams
  - Software Specification documents where things needs to be detailed and accurate
