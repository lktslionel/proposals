## Abstract

Building software today is become as esay as it was before. We have Frameworks and Tools that help us manage our development process from the early stage of your development till the deployment of your code to a target environment. In fact, while creating a project we the put too much emphasis on the choice of the framework to use, and less too the business problem we try to solve.
