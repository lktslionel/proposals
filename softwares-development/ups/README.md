## Abstract

This document is an attempt to describe what I named UPS (Universal Project Structure). UPS is an project structure that is meant to be used for any kind of software project. Throughout this document I'll try to explain the philosphy and the goal behind this project structure, the main parts of this folder structure, how does it fit well for any kind of development and what benefits you could get from it.

* To setup our porject for development
* To add third-party libraries to our project
* And more.

As a result, those frameworks and tools tend to shift our focus to the least relevant part of the project. In fact, 
while creating a project we the put too much emphasis on 
choosing a framework to use, and less attention to the business problem we try to solve.

Moreover, each framework come with its own conventions, 
folder structure and tooling that prevent us from defining 
a common way of building, testing and deploying all 
different applications with got. In fact we should too much
